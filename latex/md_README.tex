This application allows, from a vector of 14 integer positions, to calculate/return the following results\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Return a random element from a vector;
\item Calculation of the natural logarithm of each element of the vector;
\item Returning the vector with the first half of the values sorted in ascending order;
\item Returning elements of the vector that are not divisible by 3;
\item Calculation of the average value of all elements of the vector;
\item Formation of a square matrix (14x14) resulting from permutations of the elements of the initial vector;
\item Inner product of two vectors (initial vector and what will be requested during the operation);
\item Presentation of decomposing the odd elements of the initial vector into prime numbers;
\item Cross product between the initial vector and another that will be requested;
\item Calculation of the determinant of the aforementioned Matrix;
\item Help will be provided with the --help flag at runtime and help will also be provided in the menu under number 7;
