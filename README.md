# Matrix Calculator for School Project

This application allows, from a vector of 14 integer positions, to calculate/return the following results:
1. Return a random element from a vector;
2. Calculation of the natural logarithm of each element of the vector;
3. Returning the vector with the first half of the values sorted in ascending order;
4. Returning elements of the vector that are not divisible by 3;
5. Calculation of the average value of all elements of the vector;
6. Formation of a square matrix (14x14) resulting from permutations of the elements of the initial vector;
7. Inner product of two vectors (initial vector and what will be requested during the operation); 
8. Presentation of decomposing the odd elements of the initial vector into prime numbers;
9. Cross product between the initial vector and another that will be requested;
10. Calculation of the determinant of the aforementioned Matrix;
11. Help will be provided with the --help flag at runtime and help will also be provided in the menu under number 7;

## Installation

Follow the steps below to be able to use the application.

```terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:/silvatiago1/Trabalho_LP_Grupo_17.git

$ make
```

## Usage
- ### Help commands at runtime
```
$ make help
```
or 
```
$ ./main.exe --help
```

- ### Help command after execution
```bash
1-Retorno de um elemento aleatório desse vector
2-Cálculo do logaritmo natural de todos os elementos do vector
3-Devolução do vetor com a primeira metade dos valores ordenada por ordem crescente
4-Valores do vector que não sáo divisíveis por 3
5-Média de todos os elementos do vector
6-...
